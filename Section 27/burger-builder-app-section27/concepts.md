# Things to do and more ideas

- Handle the ContactData action redirect - Instead of immediately redirect to the BurgerBuilder page upon receiving a response from the server, should redirect after receiving the confirmation message in the modal.

- Add dates to the each Order component in the Orders component.

- Accordion UI for each Order component.

<!-- - Sort Orders by placing the most recent order on the top of the Orders stack. -->

- Add 'Order number' field for orders to better track them.

- Can delete an Order component.

- More functionality and options for the builder:
  - How would you like it made? Well done, Medium well, Medium, Medium rare, rare.
  - Sauces: Ketchup, Mayonnaise, Thousand islands etc.
  - Bread type: Normal, Whole-wheat, Rye.
  - Sides: Fries, Onion-rings, Salad.
  - Drink: Coke, Sprite, Sweet tea, Coffee, Water.

- Populate the About Component.

- Global messages component: a little box that sits off screen when not prompt, and whenever an 'important' event (i.e: sign up, sign in, sign out ,order received, etc) happend in the app it is prompt to the screen from the top announcing event success (or failure).

- More UI upgrades.
